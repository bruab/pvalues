This fun CLI game allows you to falsify research findings in a completely ethically defensible manner.

Take an initial sample from a population and run a t-test to see if their mean is significantly different from the population mean. If not, add samples and try again. You win if you get p < 0.05!

Depends on numpy and scipy.
